# Key Points
* Use console.log to print messages.

* Use dotted notation X.Y to get part Y of object X.

* Basic data types are Booleans, numbers, and character strings.

* Arrays store multiple values in order.

* The special values null and undefined mean ‘no value’ and ‘does not exist’.

* Define constants with const and variables with let.

* typeof returns the type of a value.

* for (let variable of collection) {...} iterates through the values in an array.

* if (condition) {...} else {...} conditionally executes some code.

* false, 0, the empty string, null, and undefined are false; everything else is true.

* Use back quotes and ${...} to interpolate values into strings.

* An object is a collection of name/value pairs written in {...}.

* object[key] or object.key gets a value from an object.

* Functions are objects that can be assigned to variables, stored in lists, etc.

* function name(...parameters...) {...body...} is the old way to define a function.

* name = (...parameters...) => {...body...} is the new way to define a function.

* Use return inside a function body to return a value at any point.

* Use modules to divide code between multiple files for re-use.

* Assign to module.exports to specify what a module exports.

* require(...path...) imports a module.

* Paths beginning with ‘.’ or ‘/’ are imported locally, but paths without ‘.’ or ‘/’ look in the library.
