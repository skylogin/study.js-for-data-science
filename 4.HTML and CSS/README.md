# Key Points
* HTML is the latest in a long line of markup languages.

* HTML documents contain elements (represented by tags in angle brackets) and text.

* Elements must be strictly nested.

* Elements can contain attributes.

* Use escape sequences beginning with ampersand to represent special characters.

* Every page should have one html element containing a head and a body.

* Use <!--...--> to include comments in HTML.

* Use ul and ol for unordered and ordered lists, and li for list elements.

* Use table for tables, tr for rows, th for headings, and td for regular data.

* Use <a href="...">...</a> to create links.

* Use <img src="..." title="..." alt="..." /> to include images.

* Use CSS to define appearance of elements.

* Use class and id to identify elements.

* Use selectors to specify the elements that CSS applies to.
