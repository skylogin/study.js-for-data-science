# Key Points
* JavaScript stores the instructions making up a function in memory like any other object.

* Function objects can be assigned to variables, put in lists, passed as arguments to other functions, etc.

* Functions can be defined in place without ever being given a name.

* A callback function is one that is passed in to another function for it to execute at a particular moment.

* Functional programming uses higher-order functions on immutable data.

* Array.some is true if any element in an array passes a test, while Array.every is true if they all do.

* Array.filter selects elements of an array that pass a test.

* Array.map creates a new array by transforming values in an existing one.

* Array.reduce reduces an array to a single value.

* A closure is a set of variables captured during the definition of a function.
